# From Wireframes to Webpages

Use your knowledge of HTML/CSS to turn your hi-fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version)

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **2 hours 30 minutes** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Team

Same pairs as yesterday.

## Brief

Work on the following task:

- **Turn** your high fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version), using the Scrum board you built the day before
- **Build** your 2 chosen screens per pair - you can either work as a pair on the two screens or choose to divide the load and build a screen each
- **Follow** your scrum board, moving tasks from `To Do` to `In Progress` and eventually to `Done` as you complete them 
- **Make** sure each person gets to code during the process
- **Focus** on the structure (HTML) and look/feel of your app (CSS) - no need to implement interaction 
- **Consider** how users on different devices, with different screen dimensions, might interact with your page. Can you make your design **responsive**?
  
## Output

Build two screens for the chosen app.
