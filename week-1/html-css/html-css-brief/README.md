# From Wireframes to Webpages

Students turn their hi-fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version)

## Organisation

### Duration

3 hours with some breaks in between - the breaks can be chosen by students whenever they feel the need 

### Team

Same pairs as earlier in the day.

## Learning objectives

- **Create** a user interface that prioritizes accessibility and responsiveness according to provided specifications.
- **Modify** a design to suit alternative mediums while maintaining its integrity and usability.
  
## Brief

- Turn your high fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version)
- Build your 2 chosen screens per pair - you can either work as a pair on the two screens or choose to divide the load and build a screen each
- Make sure each person gets to code during the process
- No need to implement interaction - focus on the structure (HTML) and look/feel of your app (CSS)
- If time allows, consider how users on different devices, with different screen dimensions, might interact with your page. Can you make your design **responsive**?

## Output

Each pair should enhance their two screens using Bootstrap.
