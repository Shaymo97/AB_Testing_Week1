# From Wireframes to Webpages

Use your knowledge of HTML/CSS to turn your hi-fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version)

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **3 hours** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Team

Same pairs as yesterday.

## Brief

Work on the following tasks:

- Turn your high fi wireframes into a webpage (desktop version)
- Build your 2 chosen screens per pair - you can either work as a pair on the two screens or choose to divide the load and build a screen each
- Make sure each person gets to code during the process
- No need to implement interaction - focus on the structure (HTML) and look/feel of your app (CSS)
- If time allows, consider how users on different devices, with different screen dimensions, might interact with your page. Can you make your design **responsive**?

## Output

Build two screens for the chosen app.
