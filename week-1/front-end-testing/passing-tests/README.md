# Passing tests

Practice of your testing knowlege and JavaScript coding skills by analysing an existing test suite & writing functions to ensure the successful passage of all tests.

## Interpersonal Skills

Testing is a crucial aspect of writing quality code and being proactive in delivering robust software. This section explores how testing connects to being proactive and the importance of taking the initiative in ensuring that your code is thoroughly tested before it reaches production.

Testing is an essential skill in software development, and adopting a proactive approach to it ensures that your code is reliable, maintainable, and scalable. Rather than waiting for issues to arise, proactively writing tests for your code can help catch bugs early, improve the quality of your work, and prevent larger problems down the line when refactoring. Here's how testing ties into taking initiative and writing good code:

- **Writing comprehensive test cases by proactively creating tests**
  - Developers ensure that their code functions as expected and meets the requirements. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests help cover various aspects of the codebase to identify potential issues early.

- **Automating the testing process**
  - Automated testing helps maintain consistency, reduces the risk of human error, and ensures that tests are run frequently throughout development.

- **Debugging and improving code quality**
  - Testing encourages developers to identify edge cases and potential failures, fostering a mindset of writing more resilient code.
  - Proactive testing uncovers potential weaknesses or flaws in the code that can be addressed before they become larger issues in production.

- **Collaboration with quality in mind**
  - Testing encourages a culture of quality, where developers collaborate to ensure the code they contribute is not only functional but also thoroughly tested and error-free. 

### Interpersonal Skills during Projects

Whilst practicing these skills keep in mind, these are developing the behaviours and techniques we expect you to use whilst in your teams during both projects. 

## Brief

This folder contains a `package.json` set-up to run unit tests on code files. At the moment, the tests are all failing as the code files - and the functions that should be in them - do not exist.

Your task is to make the tests pass by implementing the necessary functions in the following files:
- `numberFunctions.js`
- `stringFunctions.js`

This will involve navigating an unfamiliar project, research, and using existing knowledge of Javascript syntax.

## Guidance

- You will need to write code within existing files to complete this task
- Do not edit the test files or the `package.json`
- There are NPM scripts that will run the tests (wholly or partially)
- Start by working on the tests in `numberFunctions.js`; the ones in `stringFunctions.js` are harder
- Reading the test code might be helpful, but it's not required - the console output from the tests should be able to guide you
- You may need to do some research to get the string tests to pass
