## Brief

- **Set up** a basic frontend application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should include interactive elements such as buttons, input fields, and event listeners.
- **Write** a series of test cases using Jest to validate different aspects of the application's functionality.
- **Test** scenarios could include:
  - Verifying that clicking a button triggers the expected event.
  - Ensuring that input fields update the DOM correctly when user input is provided.
  - Testing error handling mechanisms, such as displaying an error message when invalid input is entered.
  - Checking that the application behaves as expected under different conditions, such as when certain elements are hidden or disabled.
- **Run** the test suite and debug any failing test cases, making adjustments to the code as necessary to fix issues.
- **Refactor** and optimize your test cases to ensure they are clear, concise, and maintainable.
