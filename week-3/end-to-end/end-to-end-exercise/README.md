# End to end API - Exercises

Practice of your knowledge of all concepts covered this week by extending on the app you built with your trainers.

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **all the afternoon** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Team

Individually / can help each other out

## Set-up

- **Find** the completed code for the end to end project [here](https://github.com/LaFosseAcademy/discovery-student-repos/tree/main/week-3/end-to-end/end-to-end-project-complete), if you need it

## Brief

Apply the following extensions. The first one is the priority. The rest can be tackled ONLY if you are done with the first one.

### Extensions

- **Add** additonal routes to the API - the priority should be a `PATCH` route that updates a country's details to have full CRUD functionality 
- **Refactor** the `README` to add the additional API endpoint in the notes + add additional API endpoints example requests/ responses
- **Add** a second table in the database that should be linked to the country table using foreign keys with the associated controllers, models and routes
- **Implement** testing
- **Add** client-side functionality linked to the additional API routes

  - Add a page where users can see all countries from the database using a `GET` fetch request
  - Add a page where users can see the information of a specific country using a `GET` fetch request
  - Add a page where users can add countries to the database using a `POST` fetch request
  - Add a functionality where users can delete or edit the information of a country using a `DELETE` / `PATCH` requests

## Output

You will extend your own apps; there is no requirement for code to be shared.
