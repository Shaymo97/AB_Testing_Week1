# Extending auth

A practice of extending the auth functionality on the application built in the previous workshop

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **1 hour** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Team

This task should be completed individually.

## Brief

The existing app implements a simple authentication flow, with only authorised users able to see any posts on the app.

This flow (and the app itself) should be extended to meet the following requirements:

- Tokens get deleted when the user clicks the 'log out' link
- Posts can be deleted using the client interface
- A post can only be deleted by its creator or any site admin

### Extension

- Posts can be edited using the client interface
- A post can only be edited by its creator

### Guidance

You will need to make changes to several files to complete these challenges - for e.g, challenges 3 and 5 will require an expansion of the data model and the post routes.

## Output

You will extend your own apps; there is no requirement for code to be shared.
