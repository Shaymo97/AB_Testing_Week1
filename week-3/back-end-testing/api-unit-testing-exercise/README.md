# API Testing Challenge - Unit Tests

A practice of API unit testing by implementing additional unit tests to the GOAT API. 

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **2 hours** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Set-up

Use the repo & code from the previous workshop

### Team

This task should be completed individually.

## Brief

The existing API doesn't have unit tests for the `destroy` and `update` models and controllers. 

Your task is to implement the following:
- Unit tests for the `destroy` model & controller
- Unit tests for the `update` model & controller

Your trainer will be sharing the solution with you at the end of the day. 

## Output

You will extend their own apps; there is no requirement for code to be shared.
