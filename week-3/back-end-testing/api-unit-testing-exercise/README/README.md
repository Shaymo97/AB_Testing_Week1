# API Testing Challenge - Unit Tests

In this activity, students implement additional tests to the GOAT API. 

## Organisation

### Duration

Students have **2 hours** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Set-up

Students can use the repo & code from the previous workshop

### Team

This task should be completed individually.

## Learning objectives

- **Develop** unit tests for backend APIs using Jest.
- **Analyze** the results of API tests to identify areas for improvement in backend code quality and performance.

## Brief

The exisiting API doesn't have unit tests for the `destroy` and `update` models and controllers. 

The task is to implement the following:
- Unit tests for the `destroy` model & controller
- Unit tests for the `update` model & controller

Once finished, the trainer can share the solution with students, found [here](https://github.com/LaFosseAcademy/testing/tree/lap2-testing-backend-completed)

## Output

Students will extend their own apps; there is no requirement for code to be shared.
