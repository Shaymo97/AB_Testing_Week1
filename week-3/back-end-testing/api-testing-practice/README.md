# API Testing Practice

In this activity, students implement unit & integration tests to an API of their choice.

## Organisation

### Duration

Students have **1 hour** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Set-up

Students work on an existing API project

### Team

This task should be completed individually.

## Learning objectives

- **Develop** unit tests for backend APIs using Jest.
- **Construct** integration tests to verify the interaction between backend components using Jest.
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of unit and integration tests in ensuring the functionality and reliability of backend APIs.
- **Apply** testing strategies to identify and resolve potential issues in backend API implementations.
- **Analyze** the results of API tests to identify areas for improvement in backend code quality and performance.

## Brief

The task is to implement unit & integration tests to any API

Students can use the finished code from the day's workshops, found [here](https://github.com/LaFosseAcademy/testing/tree/lap2-testing-backend-completed)

## Output

Students will extend their own apps; there is no requirement for code to be shared.
