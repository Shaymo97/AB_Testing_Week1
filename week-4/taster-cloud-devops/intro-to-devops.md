# DevOps

This document is designed to give students an outline about DevOps.

## Why DevOps exists

DevOps is a job and a practice because it addresses the historically separate roles and responsibilities of a **development team** and an **operations team** in the development and deployment processes. 

The traditional separation between these teams often leads to inefficiencies and bottlenecks, impacting the time it takes to bring new features or products to the market. 

Additionaly it lead to:

- **Deployment Delays** as code handoff from Devs to Ops can be slow causing delays in getting features to production
- **Environment Differences** can cause issues if the developers environment may not match the environment used in production
- **Blame culture** when issues arise rather than a collaborative solution 

## The Role of DevOps
DevOps aims to bridge the gap between development and operations by promoting a culture of collaboration, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement. 

Key principles and practices include:
1. **Collaboration and Communication**
  - Breaking down silos and fostering open communication between Devs and Ops.
  - Shared goals and metrics to align efforts towards common objectives.
2. **Automation**
  - Automating repetitive and error-prone tasks such as testing, integration and deployment .
  - **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipelines to ensure code changes are automatically testing and deployed.
3. **Infrastructure As Code**
  - Managing infrastructure using code and version control, enabling consistent environments and easy scaling. 
  - Tools like Terraform / Ansible.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**
  - Implementing robust monitoring and logging to detect issues early and respond quickly.
  - Ensuring visibility into application performance and infrastructure health. 
5. **Cultural Shift**
  - Encouraging a mindset of shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle.
  - Blameless post-mortems and continuous learning from failures. 

## External DevOps Definitions 

### AWS
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies practices, and tools that increases an organisations ability to delver applications and services with high velocity.

### Walter L Leite
DevOps is a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort within an orgaisation to automate continuous delivery of new software versions, while guaranteeing their correctness and reliability.

### DevOps Handbook
DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value steam.

DevOps relies on bodies of knowledge from Lean, Theory of Constraints, the Toyota Production System, resilience engineering, learning organisations, safety culture, human facets and many others.

The result is world-class reliability, stability, and security at ever low cost and effort; and accelerated flow and reliability through the technology value stream, including Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec.
