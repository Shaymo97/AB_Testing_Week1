These task should be completed individually.

## Brief

The exercise is revolved around 'Dockerising' current and potential MVC / APIs.

- Build a Docker Image for the `hello-world-java` application. 
- Create or use a pre-existing simple Express API with or without a connection to a database. Build the service as a Docker Image and publish that image to Docker Hub.
