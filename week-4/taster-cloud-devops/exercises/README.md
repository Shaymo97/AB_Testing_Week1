These task should be completed individually.

## Brief

The exercise is revolved around 'Dockerising' current and potential MVC / APIs.

- Build Docker Images for the `hello-world-python` and `hello-world-java` applications. 
- Create or use a pre-existing simple Express API without a connection to a database. Build the service as a Docker Image and publish that image to Docker Hub
- Create a simple Express API connected to a database and when complete build that service as a Docker Image and publish that image to Docker Hub.

### Extension
- Look into how you could create a **PostgreSQL DB** Docker Image and how to access that database using `psql`.
