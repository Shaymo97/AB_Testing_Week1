# Making a game

Practice your new knowledge of OOP and Javascript to build simple terminal-based games.

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **2 hours** to make as much progress on this task as possible

### Team

Pairs of students.

## Brief

**Objective:** Build a rock-paper-scissors game using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript.

**Define three classes:**
- Player
- HumanPlayer (subclass of Player)
- ComputerPlayer (subclass of Player)

**Implement Game Logic:**
- Create a `Game` class to handle the game logic and interactions between players.

**Test the Game:**
- Instantiate a human player and a computer player.
- Create a new game instance with the two players.
- Play the game for a specified number of rounds.
- When the user completes a game - win or lose - they should be prompted to begin another one.

**The program should only use console output; no graphics are needed.**

### Extensions

- The game should keep track of the user's results, and display them when prompted
- Any additional features that you wish

### Guidance

- Start with pseudocode
- Build a **minimum viable product** (MVP): build the simplest possible form of the game, and then make it more complicated
- You will have to do some research to work out how to solve specific problems

## Output

You should produce a simple game using OOP and push to your own Github repositories. A link to your game can then be shared with the rest of the class.

### Suggested questions if you finish early

If you finish early, think of the following:

- What if the user enters 'Rock'?
- What if the user enters 'gryphon'?
- Wouldn't it be great if the output was coloured to match wins/losses/draws?
- What if the user wants to quit during a game?
- What if the user forgets the rules halfway through?
- What if the user wants to store their game record even when the program isn't running?
