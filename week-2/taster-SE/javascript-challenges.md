# JavaScript Challenges

## Warm-up challenges

**1) Problem - Reverse a String**

- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

        Input: "hello"
        Output: "olleh"

**2) Problem - Find the Largest Number in an Array**

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

        Input: [1, 6, 3, 4, 5]
        Output: 6

**3) Problem - Count the Vowels**

- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels `(a, e, i, o, u)` in the string.
      
        Input: "hello"
        Output: 2

**4) Problem - Remove Duplicates from an Array:**

- Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with duplicates removed.

        Input: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 10, 10, 11]
        Output: [1, 2, 4, 10, 11]

**5) Problem - Sum of Array Elements**

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all elements in the array.
  
        Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Output: 15

**6) Problem - Check for Palindrome**

- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.
        
        Input: "racecar"
        Output: true

  
## JavaScript Coding Challenges

### Beginner Level

**1) Problem - Fizzbuzz**

- Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; and for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

**2) Problem: Find the longest word**

- Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence.

**3) Problem: Two Sum**

- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**4) Problem: Find Second Largest Number in an Array**

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the second largest number in the array.

**5) Problem: Check for Even or Odd**

- Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

### Intermediate Level

**1) Problem - Find the Factorial of a Number**

- Write a function that takes a number as input and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

**2) Problem - Find Missing Number in Sequence**

- Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, write a function to find the one missing number.

**3) Problem - Merge Two Sorted Arrays** 

- Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

**4) Problem - Replace One Character With Another** 

- Write a function that replaces every occurrence of a given character in a string with another.

**5) Problem - Find all pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a given number** 

- Write a function that will pair up the array element whose sum is equal to a given number.

### Advanced Level

**1) Problem - Anagram** 

- Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other, meaning they contain the same characters in a different order. This algorithm tests your ability to analyze and rearrange data.

**2) Problem - Pyramid String Pattern**

- Write a function that builds a pyramid with strings. This algorithm takes your loop skills further, challenging you to create a visually structured output.

**3) Problem - Combination Sum**

- Write a function that returns a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target, given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target

**4) Problem - Jump Game**

- Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Determine if you can reach the last index.

**5) Problem - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

- Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
