# Agile Project

Practice of your knowledge of Agile methodologies to create a **Scrum board** for your end-to-end project 

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **1 hour** to make as much progress on this task as possible. Your trainer will check your boards half way through the activity. 

### Team

Same pairs as the rest of the day

## Brief

### Instructions

The goal of this activity is to create a **scrum board** using the knowledge acquired in the previous lecture. You will revisit the wireframes you created earlier in the day and use them as a foundation for crafting your board. Follow the instructions below: 

- **Get** into your pairs and get the wireframes created earlier in the day.
- **Identify** tasks needed to bring your wireframes to life (turn them into a real webpage), breaking down the work into smaller, manageable chunks.
- **Make** a Scrum board for your team. You can use a physical board or an online tool such as Trello.
- **Divide** it into columns for things you need to do (To Do), things you're working on (In Progress), and things that are finished (Done).
- **Start** populating the board with tasks derived from your wireframes, ensuring they are actionable and clearly defined.
